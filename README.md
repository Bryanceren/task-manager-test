## Project description
This is a project made with react.js, implementing apollo client and styled components,
because these technologies work so grea together, and the way you can improve your
components with dynamic styling is just awesome. I also decided to connect to the 
backend API using apollo since I never used it before and therefore I wanted
to take that challenge and the opportunity to learn something new, same thing
happened with styled components because I did not know how it worked,
regarding to te folder structure, I looked for best practices and I
was so doubtful about what style should I choose.
I learned so much making this test and I am looking fordward to learn more
This application's functionality is about a task management site, where you can add some 
tasks in order to keep you workspace organized and clean.
